ABOUT US
-----------

Hello, and welcome to Defendo GitHub repository. Imagine a university where accessing spaces and services is secure, seamless, and efficient; now, this can be possible. We have develop a groundbreaking solution designed to transform campus life through our innovative Digital ID Card application.

THE PROBLEM
----------------
Universities face growing challenges in maintaining security, improving accessibility, and offering convenience to students. Traditional ID cards are prone to theft, loss, and limited functionality, leading to inefficiencies and increased risks. Whether it’s entering gender-separated bathrooms, accessing classrooms, or managing payments in the dining hall, students often struggle with outdated systems.

OUR SOLUTION - DIGITAL ID CARD
---------------------------------------
We bring you a comprehensive Digital ID Card that integrates security and convenience like never before. This app-based solution allows students to seamlessly access spaces like classrooms, libraries, and gender-separated bathrooms with a simple tap on their phones, eliminating the need for physical keys or ID cards. They can also use the app to pay at the dining hall, vending machines, or other campus facilities, replacing cash. Additionally, it enables students to reserve library resources, book study rooms, and access digital materials, all in one place.
